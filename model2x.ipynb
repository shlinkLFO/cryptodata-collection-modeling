    "General Hierarchy of Hyperparameter Importance (often, but context matters):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. eta (learning_rate) & n_estimators: These are highly impactful and strongly linked. Lower eta generally requires higher n_estimators for convergence. Finding a good balance is crucial for performance.\n",
    "2. max_depth: Controls the complexity of individual trees. Very important for preventing overfitting/underfitting.\n",
    "3. subsample & colsample_bytree (or _bylevel, _bynode): Introduce stochasticity, reducing variance and preventing overfitting. Often provide good gains.\n",
    "4. min_child_weight: Acts as a regularizer, particularly useful on imbalanced datasets to prevent trees from focusing too much on single outlier instances of the minority class.\n",
    "5. gamma (min_split_loss): Another regularization parameter, controlling whether a split is made based on loss reduction.\n",
    "6. Regularization (lambda, alpha): L2 and L1 regularization help prevent overfitting by shrinking weights. They are important, but often fine-tuning them yields smaller gains compared to getting the core structure (max_depth, eta/n_estimators) right, unless you have severe overfitting issues."

    "Here are typical considerations for fixed values:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. gamma (min_split_loss):\n",
    "Purpose: Controls the minimum loss reduction needed to make a split. Higher values lead to fewer splits (more conservative).\n",
    "Default: 0 (allows any split that reduces loss, even slightly).\n",
    "Typical Fixed Value: 0. Sticking with the default is very common if you are not tuning it. It allows the tree to grow based purely on loss improvement.\n",
    "Slightly More Conservative Fixed Value: Sometimes people might use a very small value like 0.1 or 0.2 if they want to introduce a tiny barrier against splitting on minimal gains, but usually, it's kept at 0 unless tuned.\n",
    "Range Idea: Think 0 to ~1 as the area of most impact; values much larger quickly prune the tree heavily.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. lambda (reg_lambda / L2 Regularization):\n",
    "Purpose: Penalizes large weights using the square of their magnitude. Encourages smaller, more distributed weights, good for preventing overfitting when features might be correlated.\n",
    "Default: 1. This already provides a moderate amount of L2 regularization.\n",
    "Typical Fixed Value: 1. The default is a very sensible starting point and often used as the fixed value.\n",
    "Alternative Moderate Fixed Values: Values between 0.5 and 2 are generally considered moderate L2 regularization. You could fix it at 1.5 (like you had) or 1 without drastically changing the regularization strength compared to the default.\n",
    "Range Idea: 0 means no L2. Values from 0.1 to 10 cover a wide range from weak to strong regularization.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. alpha (reg_alpha / L1 Regularization):\n",
    "Purpose: Penalizes large weights using their absolute magnitude. Can drive feature weights to exactly zero, performing implicit feature selection.\n",
    "Default: 0 (no L1 regularization).\n",
    "Typical Fixed Value: 0. If you don't have a specific reason to encourage sparsity or perform L1 feature selection, leaving it at the default is standard practice.\n",
    "Slightly More Conservative Fixed Value: If you suspect some L1 might help a little without tuning, a very small value like 0.01 or 0.1 might be chosen. But often, if L1 is desired, it's added to the tuning grid.\n",
    "Range Idea: Similar to lambda, 0 means no L1, and values from 0.1 to 10 cover weak to strong L1 effects.\n",
